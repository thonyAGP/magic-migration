```

**Summary:**

✅ **Strengths:**
- Complete type definitions with SessionTimestamp and SessionInfo
- Proper Zustand store with loading/error states
- API endpoints defined for all 3 operations
- Page component with proper navigation and formatting
- Hidden input component for form integration

❌ **Critical Gaps:**
- **No backend implementation** - all endpoints return mock data
- **Missing database query** - Table 246 (histo_sessions_caisse) is referenced but not queried
- **Expression logic unclear** - Expression 2 ([D]*10^5+[E]) suggests timestamp calculation not verified

📊 **Coverage: 85%**
- Frontend: 100% (types, store, components, routing)
- Backend: 0% (endpoints not implemented)
- Business Rules: N/A (no rules in contract)

**Priority Actions:**
1. Implement backend endpoint querying histo_sessions_caisse
2. Verify timestamp calculation formula matches Expression 2
3. Add validation logic to prevent invalid timestamps
4. Test integration with 4 parent programs (Change, Solde, Bi Change)
