    "The UI implements filters (date range, status, operator) but the spec states 'lecture seule' - confirm if write operations should be completely disabled in the UI",
    "SessionDetailsPanel and SessionCurrenciesPanel are implemented but not visible in SessionHistoryPage.tsx - wire these components to display when a session is selected",
    "Add audit trail metadata to SessionHistoryItem type (e.g., lastAccessedBy, lastAccessedAt) to support the 'traçabilité complète' requirement",
    "The spec mentions 'appelé depuis la gestion caisse principale (IDE 121)' - ensure proper navigation integration from GestionCaissePage",
    "Add loading state indicators for session details and currencies fetch operations",
    "Implement the 'titre' column from table 246 in the SessionHistoryItem type and display it in the sessions list",
    "The OperationsGridPanel export functionality generates CSV with hardcoded headers that don't match the actual session history data structure - fix the export mapping",
    "Add TypeScript strict null checks for closedDate and closedTime fields to prevent runtime errors",
    "Implement proper error recovery when session details or currencies fail to load (currently only shows loading state)"

}
```

**Summary:**

The implementation covers **75%** of the specification requirements. The main gaps are:

1. **Missing business logic validations** (2 rules): The spec explicitly mentions two boolean control variables that validate session existence and status before display, but these checks are absent in the store.

2. **Incomplete component wiring**: SessionDetailsPanel and SessionCurrenciesPanel are built but not integrated into the main page flow.

3. **Data model gaps**: Missing the `titre` field from table 246 and audit trail metadata for traceability.

4. **CSV export misalignment**: The export feature in OperationsGridPanel doesn't match the actual data structure.

The positive aspects are solid UI implementation, proper Zustand store structure, mock data generation, and comprehensive filtering capabilities. The code is well-typed and follows React best practices, but needs the critical validation logic to match the spec's requirements.
