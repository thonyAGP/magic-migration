  notes: "Pure backend utility. This is a simple lookup function (code -> title/civilite) used by 20+ callers. In the web architecture, this becomes a server-side helper function or a cached reference table. The frontend never resolves titles from codes directly - it receives pre-resolved data from API. The i18n/fr.ts file contains static titles but for UI labels, not dynamic lookup. Coverage is 0% because all functionality is N/A for frontend - this is a backend-only migration target."
